Automated Heterogeneous IoT Attack Detection through Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Dynamic Machine Learning Approach

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a dynamic machine learning approach which combines RL and deep learning algorithms. In comparison with the traditional machine learning approaches, RL agent directly interacts with the environment and learns without supervision. DRL is an innovative strategy that does not require any prior knowledge of training datasets. It is a modernized mechanism which makes use of the feedback received from the action-space and works well especially with generated dynamic traffic.The project implements four DRL algorithms, namely the Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Actor-Critic (A2C) and Kronecker-Factored Approximation (KFA) for IoT data traffic to understand their anomalies. This is done by studying the DRL problem for IoT devices, followed by the injection of intruder attacks into the system through Label Flipping Attack (LFA). An AI model is designed to mimic the IoT detection criteria, together with two defence mechanisms: Label-based Semi-supervised Defence (LSD) and Clustering-based Semi-supervised Defence (CSD). The proposed solution is tested on various IoT scenarios and the adaptive model is verified using Machine Learning (ML) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The three datasets presented are the CICIDS2017, NSL-KDD, IoT-23 and NBaIoT datasets.
